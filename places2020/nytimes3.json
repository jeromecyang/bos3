In Washington, institutions like the Library of Congress, the National Museum of American History and the National Archives Museum have long-running exhibitions either under way or planned to commemorate the milestone and those whom it left out. (Admission to all three is free, as it is to most of the city’s museums and monuments.) In an election year of perhaps unprecedented political angst, some might find visiting the nation’s capital fraught. But in recent years Washington has watched its already-rich culture and dining scene blossom, offering a vast menu of fresh sights and tastes. Away from the halls of government, Washington presents a diverse identity as a majority-minority city and a cosmopolitan crossroads where American society blends with international influences. The U Street area, sometimes referred to as Black Broadway, is packed with historic theaters and concert halls where jazz flourished and go-go music was pioneered. Beyond a small but growing set of pricier Michelin-starred restaurants, Washington has also seen a younger, forward-thinking crop of restaurants emerge, with Ethiopian and Laotian food well represented. Even as a modern, homegrown and ever-changing culture percolates below the surface, though, Washington holds to its historical ideal of a city built on a common heritage — a place for all Americans to reflect on a shared identity, even in a contentious election year."},{"name":"British Virgin Islands","country":"British Virgin Islands","source":"NYT","region":"Carribeans","id":22,"latitude":18.4207,"longitude":-64.64,"media":"https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/12/01/places-to-go-2020/assets/images/british-virgin-islands-2000.jpg","summary":"An island chain devastated by hurricanes rebounds with an environmental bent","description":"Hit by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, the British Virgin Islands have been slow to recover.

With rotating exhibitions, educational activities to engage the local community, a residency program and an on-site locavore restaurant, the gallery’s arrival complements the island’s strict focus on conservation and slow tourism. In lodgings, visitors have more choice as boutique hotels are sprouting that put sustainability at heart, too. Opened late last summer, Menorca Experimental is a 43-room farmhouse surrounded by wild gardens, while Torre Vella and Santa Ponsa are two secluded fincas (agricultural estates with ancient farmhouses) that have been painstakingly restored. Spanning 740 acres of working farmland that produce olive oil, aromatics and organic vegetables, both make for stylish bases to explore as locals do — slowly."},{"name":"Oberammergau","country":"Germany","source":"NYT","region":"Eu W","id":62,"latitude":47.5981,"longitude":11.0642,"media":"https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/12/01/places-to-go-2020/assets/images/oberammergau-2000.jpg","summary":"A once-a-decade Passion Play approaches its 400th year","description":"The Bavarian village of Oberammergau has a population of 5,400, but it is expected to pull in half a million visitors in 2020 with its once-a-decade Passion Play, which runs from May 16 through Oct. 4. The first performance was held in 1634 and, for the first time in the play’s nearly 400-year history, an equal number of men and women will participate this year in various roles. The five-hour narrative focuses on the last days of Jesus’ life — from the Last Supper to the crucifixion — and taps into the talents of more than 2,000 residents born and raised in the village. Christian Stückl, who directs the play for the fourth time, hopes to tell the story in a novel way with refreshed tableaux vivants, or “living pictures,” and an edited script that portrays Jesus as a figure “relevant to today’s world, who is with those marginalized by society,” he said. A partnership with the train operator Deutsche Bahn ensures late-night departures back to Munich, and there are specially discounted performances for younger visitors on May 8 and 9. Oberammergau is also known for its woodcarving legacy, and whittlers, or “Herrgottschnitzer,” take great pride in making wooden Christian motifs."},{"name":"Plymouth","country":"UK","source":"NYT","region":"Eu W","id":63,"latitude":50.3755,"longitude":-4.1427,"media":"https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/12/01/places-to-go-2020/assets/images/plymouth-2000.jpg","summary":"A revitalized port city marks a historic occasion","description":"This is the 400th anniversary year of the Mayflower’s voyage from Plymouth to the New World, and this fascinating city in southwest England will mark the occasion with more than 100 events.

(Plymouth, Mass., and other places will also take part.) Plymouth, which bills itself as Britain’s Ocean City, has been enjoying a resurgence in recent years. High-profile chefs have opened restaurants and wine bars on the waterfront, like Pier One Bistro, the Honky Tonk Wine Library and Bonne Santé, and the once-quiet Barbican district is now full of cafes and bars. There are hundreds of historic buildings, including the recently restored 16th-century Elizabethan House, once a “slum house” where as many as 58 people lived. (A new Mayflower Digital Trails app is available to guide visitors to historic sites). And this spring brings the opening of The Box, a striking new cultural precinct featuring a regional archive, a history museum and contemporary art exhibitions.

Protecting more of Brazil’s — and the planet’s — precious resources is the premise behind a major, multitiered conservation effort now under way in the country’s Atlantic Forest. One of the richest ecosystems on the planet, the Atlantic Forest biome hugs Brazil’s eastern coastline, and is home to Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and more than 3,400 cities and towns. The effort, a proposed 2,485-mile hiker-friendly trail — half of which is complete — would formalize a continuous trail by connecting existing hiking paths through five states and raise public awareness of the Atlantic Forest’s importance and vulnerability. The conservation group WWF Brazil, which is leading the project along with private and public sector partners, believes attracting visitors will create more interest in protecting a public heritage and shoring up conservation efforts that have been weakened by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

A favored late-19th-century hideaway for artists like Claude Monet, who made its dramatic beaches the subject of many paintings, and the actress Sarah Bernhardt, who created a summer house from a disused stone fort at the Pointe des Poulains, Belle-Île is 45 minutes from Quiberon by ferry. An electric-rental-car service, inaugurated in 2019, is the latest in a variety of eco-responsible initiatives intended to preserve its natural beauty.

Access is now easier — it’s a pine-fringed 200-mile drive from Barcelona, thanks to improved roadways and a tunnel — but the Val d’Aran is still a culture apart. The centuries-long isolation preserved its medieval villages, Aranese language and pristine wilderness, which serves as the magnificent backdrop for an emerging outdoor adventure scene that remains largely eclipsed by the dazzle of Barcelona and the coast. The soaring Baqueira-Beret ski resort now has more than 100 miles of runs, with a recent expansion to its highest peak, Cap de Baciver, as well as off-piste terrain around Escornacrabes (“Where Goats Fall”). Refuel at lively wine bars and restaurants (this is Spain, after all) like Cinco Jotas Baqueira, where you can feast on ham made from acorn-fed pigs. The valley is also newly claiming summer, with hiking and biking trails that fan out across the Pyrenees, including an upgraded section of the Camino de Santiago and a new cycle path on the Garonne River.

It might be hard to imagine this sparsely populated country becoming spoiled — but its tourist numbers are on the rise, and so is its infrastructure. Last year Mongolia attracted 530,000 tourists, up from 150,000 in 2000. Ulaanbaatar, the capital, is opening a new airport, scheduled for completion by the end of May. Financed by the Japanese government, it will accommodate triple the passengers of the current one. More direct routes from Asian destinations are expected, too. Today, Mongolia has more than 400 travel companies, 300 hotels and 600 resorts and tourist camps. The government is giving tax breaks to companies building hotels and has abolished licenses for tourism businesses. It even has a tourism slogan: “Mongolia — Nomadic by Nature.” Some popular activities include trekking, climbing, birding, horseback riding, camel trekking and yak caravans. Nearly every travel company includes the Gobi Desert on its itinerary. One great cultural event is the Naadam sports festival held in July.

In 2016, its chief city, Ljubljana, was named European Green Capital. In 2017, Slovenia became the first country certified as a “green destination.” So it comes as no surprise that this mountainous swath of land — the size of Massachusetts with a population of two million — recently put the final touches on the new sustainability-focused Juliana Trail, in time to receive trekkers for spring 2020. The 166-mile hiking loop, which circumnavigates Triglav National Park (and its 9,395-foot Mount Triglav) and connects villages throughout southeastern Europe’s Julian Alps, has a twofold raison d’être. One is obvious: to provide adventurers with a route traversing the country’s scenic highlights — like the photo-op-friendly Lake Bled, the emerald-green Soca River and glacial Lake Bohinj. But the path will also spread out visitor traffic, reduce tourist bottlenecks and bring more travelers to overlooked spots along the way. Responsibility, after all, is at the heart of Slovenia’s tourism master plan. “It’s not enough to love a landscape today,” says Janko Humar, director of the Soca Valley Tourist Board. “You have to proactively manage to preserve the future.”"},{"name":"Addis Ababa","country":"Ethiopia","source":"NYT","region":"Africa E","id":69,"latitude":8.9806,"longitude":38.7578,"media":"https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/12/01/places-to-go-2020/assets/images/addis-2000.jpg","summary":"A fast-growing economy is bringing sustainable tourism — and an expanded airport — to the Ethiopian capital","description":"Ethiopia, where coffee is said to have originated, where Stone Age ancestors first carved flint into tools and where churches were hewn into rock and perched atop cliffs, is Africa’s fastest-expanding economy.

Of all the old-growth primary forest that remains in Europe, 65 percent of it is there. These forests, home to bears, wolves and an incredible array of flora and fauna besides, are found all around the country, but you could do worse than head to the Southern Carpathian Mountains, also known as the Transylvanian Alps, for the full experience. A visit to the Domogled-Valea Cernei National Park, or the Fagaras mountain ranges farther east, offers thousands of acres of truly untouched nature alongside opportunities for hiking, camping, swimming under waterfalls and more. Romania’s very decent roads (one of which, the Transfagarasan, is a destination in itself for motoring enthusiasts) make it possible to reach all of this, even on shorter trips. There’s never been a more important moment to see and celebrate these forests: Despite the efforts of conservationists including Britain’s Prince Charles, who called them “a priceless natural treasure in a continent that has long since destroyed most of its wildernesses,” logging continues, some of it illegal.
